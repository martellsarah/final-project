To reproduce the code, please run in either VSCode or Google Colab and ensure no blockers prevent the LinkedIn web scraping function from running properly. Additionally, ensure the file is saved within your collab environment before running. For the Shiny app, save the file to your desktop before running.

The file is large, but we were able to save it locally and run it through Google Colab and the app through RStudio.
